    Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. You have granted us in St. Francis a powerful intercessor and a model to follow. We thanks you. Now, as we hear your voice, "build my Church," we ask you, open our hearts to your grace and our eyes to the needs of our neighbor, for it is in giving the we receive. Amen.
